                                    This design explores the transformation of one character, Elissa, into Jagoda, following a traumatic event. Once a noble heir to a powerful stronghold, Elissa was intelligent, ambitious, and drawn to forbidden blood magic. Her elegant costume—black and red robes, high collars, and gold jewelry—reflects her authority and cold charisma.
                                    <br>
                                    After a peasant uprising and the burning of her castle, Elissa is left disfigured, unconscious, and stripped of her magical artifact. She awakens in the wilderness with no memory of her past. Now known as Jagoda, she appears as a scarred, rugged woman in a servant’s dress—earthy, practical, and wounded, but still strangely skilled in herbs, leadership, and combat.
                                    <br>
                                    The concept illustrates a visual and narrative contrast between power and loss, identity and reinvention. It includes design variations, expression sheets, and a progression from aristocrat to outcast.
